# Summary
[summary]: #summary

The current way in which we manage asset dependencies is cumbersome and leads to various issues. This RFC proposes that we replace the current method with NPM and Webpack.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Currently, most assets (js/css) are used as gems and managed by bundler.
A few are included directly in the vendor/ directory due to lack of gems.
Some of the reasons that we want to change the way we currently handle this:

* Some assets are not packaged as gems, so we need to either vendor or package them ourselves.
* Some asset gems are not updated at the same rate as the upstream source.
* Each gem dependency must be packaged separately as RPM/DEB.
* Difficult to integrate newer JS technology such as es2015 or js modules.
* Assets included in the vendor/ directory need manual updating when new versions are released.

# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

NPM will be used to manage as many of the assets that are currently being vendored or bundled as possible.
If we run into issues with packages that are only available for Bower in the future, we will consider adding Bower as well. The main advantage of using only NPM is that we have a central location for all js dependencies and only one tool added rather then two, which reduces the complexity. NPM also allows namespacing JS modules using CommonJS to prevent possible collisions between various modules.
The node modules will be integrated into foreman using Webpack. Webpack has a powerful system of loaders that allow handling various tasks. Webpack also comes with a small webserver that allows live-reload of all assets managed by it, hopefully leading to increased developer happiness. In addition, webpack has various other strengths that make it seem like the current leading option - ability to handle css assets and all js module flavors, smart division of code into bundles and more.
As we will currently continue using the Rails assets pipeline, any plugin will be able to use whatever method they choose to handle any assets as long as the result is added to the pipeline (as is done currently).
After a certain period of attempting this solution, we will review the choice and decide if we wish to continue in this direction or change to a different one.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Some reasons to stay with the current solution:
* No extra work needed.
* Single package management system - bundler. All dependencies are in one central location, build process is simple.
* Rails asset pipeline doesnâ€™t require any modifications to handle the current solution.

# Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

Several other alternatives were considered before choosing this option. The alternatives considered:

For package management - NPM, Bower, remain with current solution.

For handling the assets (getting them working with foreman) - Grunt, Gulp, Webpack, Browserify, Rake.

History of the discussion and pros and cons of each option can be read in the previous commits of this file.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

* How to package rpms without internet connection, as Koji does not allow internet connection?
  * The compiled assets could be committed into source control. This has a downside of committing a large amount of generated code into git, and may lead to issues with forgetting to recompile before commit.
  * The `node_modules` directory could be added to source control. This again leads to a large amount of files that aren't required polluting our repository and issues with keeping the directory up to date.
  * Each node module could be built as a separate package. This is unfeasible, since there are hundreds of modules required for the generation of the minified files. In addition, we would not want to package every single one ourselves, given that one of the goals of this change is to reduce packaging workload.
  * The `node_modules` directory could be added to the source tarball before being sent to the builder, with the compiling and minification being run on the builder.
  * The js assets could be compiled and minified before the build and have only the resulting files be added into the tarball passed into the builder.
  * Some concern has been raised that any option other then packaging every single library may go against the Fedora Packaging Guidelines.
